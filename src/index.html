  <p class="text-justify pt-10">Inspired by both classic calligraphy and modern metalic look, I have created a new decorative font. The typeface used in the Metallica logo is called “Pastor Of Muppets.” My Fonts are inspired by the fonts used in the musical band Metallica’s logo which are fused with contrasting details that give the font a new look. The writing is characterized by contrasts and line directions: the Serif and Sans Serif fused together, the angular and rough exterior design versus the round and soft interior edge. And the stark contrast in the lines that go from bold to thin. The font is only suitable for reproduction in large formats.</p>

  <div class="pl-20 pr-20">
  <p class="text-justify pt-8 pb-20">I have researched the design on several different fonts.The classic Metallica logo features a customized sans-serif font. Every character is somewhat unusual, yet the most characteristic letters are the first and the last ones. Their shape resembles lightings. In this way, designers emphasized the wild emotions that Metallica’s music radiates. The “T” character also doesn’t look like an average “T” in a book, as the right part of the horizontal bar is longer than the left one. The type is called “Pastor of Muppets”, its author is Ray Larabie. I have researched how I can ornament the letters with garnishes and crumbs and I acn give it to my style. I have sketched by hand and found an expression and concept that should be the mainstay of my font. Then I have interest-drawn and refined the individual letters digitally.</p>
